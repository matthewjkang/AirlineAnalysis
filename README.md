3. Perform analysis to address the business problem (described below)
4. Design and create a visual storytelling presentation to describe your findings and suggested actions.
5. A written report of the storyline that you will talk about if you are to deliver this presentation

### Business Problem
---
For this problem, assume that you work at an airline company which owns and operates all of the flights that are contained in the flights database. You should write queries to pull the appropriate data and visualize the results (can be multiple charts). Create presentation slides to explain the story and communicate your recommendations.

1. The pricing team asked you to analyze the data and make recommendations on pricing changes. Specifically, they would like to know which flight routes, during which days have particularly high occupancy and therefore warrants a price increase, and vice versa (for low occupancy flights). 
### Deliverables

A zip file containing ...
1. Every SQL query written and the corresponding sample data exported to a .csv file. For the sample data, please only export a small set containing <20 rows of data. Name each csv file appropriately such that it is clear which query is used to pull the data.
2. Images of visualizations produced
3. A PDF of the presentation used to communicate the data story. 
4. A word document of the storyline that you will talk about if you are to deliver this presentation.
